# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 24, 2025

**TPWFC - Tai Po Wang Fuk Court Fire Documentation Project** (hereinafter referred to as "this website") values your privacy. As a non-profit open-source project, we adopt a minimal data collection strategy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal data.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Browsing the Website

When you simply browse this website, we do **not** require you to register an account, nor do we collect personal identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number.

### 1.2 Anonymous Collaboration

This website supports anonymous collaboration:

- We do **not** require you to log in when submitting edit suggestions.
- The system may temporarily log your IP address to prevent abuse or malicious disruption (such as DDoS attacks or spam), but this data is used solely for security protection and not for tracking individual behavior.

## 2. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

To maintain website operations and save costs, we utilize certain third-party services that may collect your data:

- **Media Hosting**: This website does not directly store images or videos uploaded by users. If you use our recommended third-party platforms (such as **8upload**, **Dailymotion**) to upload content, please refer to their respective privacy policies. Once you embed a media link into this website, it implies that the content will be publicly displayed.
- **Discord**: Our community review process takes place on Discord. If you join our Discord server to participate in discussions or reviews, your username and message history will be governed by Discord's Privacy Policy.

## 3. Use of Cookies

This website uses a minimal amount of Cookies or similar technologies, primarily to:

- Remember your preferences (such as language selection, dark mode).
- Conduct basic website traffic analysis (using Cloudflare or similar de-identified analysis tools) to optimize website performance.

We do **not** use Cookies for advertising tracking or sell your data to third parties.

## 4. Data Publicness

Please note that due to the public nature of this project:

- Content you submit to this website (such as corrected text, provided links) will be treated as public information and permanently stored in our version control system (GitHub).
- Please do not include sensitive personal data of yourself or others in your submissions.

## 5. Children's Privacy

This website is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
